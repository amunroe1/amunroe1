# Graph Implementation
## CSE 310 : Data Structures and Algorithms


### Description
This project was intended as a means of assessing the students' implementation of the cumulative knowledge of structures and algorithms taught in the class. It is an interactive program that uses the provided 'network' files as inputs and can perform many graph-traversal related operations, including shortest-path computations, and demonstrates working knowledge of stack, heap and graph data structures.

### Data Formatting
The format of the data is as follows:
The first line of the text files give the number of graph nodes followed by the number of connecting edges. All other entries contain and edge index "i", edge start-node "u", edge end-node "v" and edge-weight "w".

### Uses
To fully explore this project, it is necessary to use the g++ compiler for the C++ programming language.
